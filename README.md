Binary Enclave allows storing configuration data in a binary directly. You will
probably never find a good reason for doing this. This is primarily an exercise
for learning rust and something I found interesting. The idea originates from
the Wraith Botpack [https://github.com/wraith/wraith].

### Caveats

* Written payload is only visible upon next execution.

### Basic Usage


```rust
use binary_enclave::{enclave, Enclave}

#[enclave(appconfig)]
pub static CONFIG: Enclave<Config, 512> = Enclave::new();

fn main() {
    let conf = CONFIG.decode()?;
    let res = CONFIG.write(&Config{ some: 43, values: "see" })?;
}
```
